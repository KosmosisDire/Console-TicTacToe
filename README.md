This is a very simple but reasonably feature rish tic tac toe game that runs in the console. It only supports Windows cmd.exe due to it's use of window resizing, and fonts.

## Features:

Game Modes:
- Human vs. Human
- Human vs. Bot
- Bot vs. Bot

The AI is almost too good, but also has an element of randomness to it to make sure it isn't predictable.

Board Sizes:
- 3x3 (3 in a row to win)
- 4x4 (4 in a row to win)
- 5x5 (4 in a row to win)
- 6x6 (5 in a row to win)

Color Themes:
- There are a number of color themes to choose from. <br> The characters in the ternimal are colored to make a clean and nice looking design.

Font Size:
- Scale the UI. The only works in the windows cmd.exe.

It works in Windows Terminal, but may somtimes leave extra characters in the terminal leading to visual glitches.
